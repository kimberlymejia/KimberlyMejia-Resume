        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Kimberly Mejia, and I am a first-generation student from a low-income supportive family. I strive to become a hard-working ans successful person to provide for myself and my family. I have been shaped into the person I am through hardships and experiences. Join me on this journey of self-contemplation. Born and raised in a small, low-income city, El Monte, California. I grew up with a single mother and my younger sister, who are the reason why I wanted to pursue a higher education; they are my motivation.  
<br><br>
        Creativity makes me want to expand my horizons, and I strive for that daily. I want to become more creative and expand my imagination. I do not play any instrument, nor am I artistic. However, when it comes down to children, I apply my imagination to become more creative and try to find ways to entertain them. It has always been my interest to teach and be with children because I love to see children with smiles and be able to make them laugh with different creativity. To me, it is amazing how each student learns differently; I can use my creativity to find different methods of teaching and make it fun at the same time. I enjoyed the experience of being able to teach in a fun way where students understood me. Being able to teach in different ways that all the students understand and including each one of them drove me to become creative. I express my creativity by finding solutions where no one is left behind and everyone is included. Everyone learns differently, and sometimes it can be difficult to understand a lesson because it is being taught in a way that you are not comfortable with. This led me to pursue my passion for teaching and enrolled in the University of California, Riverside, to pursue a degree in Education, Society, and Human Development. As a current undergraduate student, I have been looking into future career paths I can pursue with my major. I am seeking a Bachelor's degree in Education, Society, & Human Development with a concentration in Education for Social Justice. After I graduate as an undergrad, I plan on getting my Masterâ€™s degree and my teaching credentials. I have also been interested in working with younger children, so my focus is kindergarten to elementary school. 
<br><br>

        During my time at the university, I have been seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and learn more about the career paths I can pursue. My ability to build strong relationships with students and parents has proven invaluable throughout my career. I understand the importance of collaboration and communication with families and believe in establishing an open and welcoming classroom environment that fosters parent involvement. In addition, I possess strong organizational skills, which enable me to manage the daily demands of a busy classroom while maintaining a positive and supportive learning atmosphere. I have a deep passion for teaching and a genuine love for working with children, which drives me to seek new ways to inspire and motivate young learners continuously.
